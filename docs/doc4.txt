ASANSOL: Justice Sanjib Bandyopadhyay of Calcutta high court on Thursday ordered that the examination for clerical jobs in the Asansol division of Life Insurance Corporation of India will be held at Army School in Panagarh on May 17 under Army cover.

The Asansol division had tried to conduct the recruitment examinations twice, but was thwarted by resistance from a section of contractual workers. Advocate Smarajit Roy Choudhury, who appear- ed for LICI, said that the court had directed that the test be conducted at a place that is under the control of the Army.

"The Army told the court that examinations can be conducted at Army School, Panagarh. Calcutta High Court has directed both the Army cantonment head in Panagarh and Burdwan police superintendent to ensure that the examinations are held peacefully," he added. The court also issued instructions to the state director general of police and Burdwan district magistrate.

Burdwan DM Saumitra Mohan and SP Kunal Aggarwal said they were yet to get a copy of the court order. Senior divisional manager of LICI, Asansol division, Jyotirmoy Barat, expressed hope that the long-pending examination for the clerical posts would now be held smoothly.
