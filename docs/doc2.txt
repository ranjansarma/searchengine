NEW DELHI: Putting a question mark on security within Tihar Jail, Delhi Police has found that not only did a dreaded gangster have access to a mobile phone in the prison, he was using it to make extortion calls to city businessmen.

Notorious criminal Naveen Bali, in jail for the past two years, has been interrogated for making the calls and arrested afresh in the case, along with three aides who allegedly did the ground work for him outside the prison.

Sources told TOI that Bali, undergoing trail in more than 20 cases of murder, dacoity, extortion and abduction, had been using the number 98**0899** (full number being withheld) to make extortion calls and communicate with fellow gangsters till last fortnight. The phone has been seized.

Bali made extortion calls on one Lalit Mathur of Rohini and demanded another Rs 50 lakh from a tile manufacture, sources said. He also used the phone to threaten one Anoop Singh, asking him to vacate his Prahladpur village plot worth crores and hand over the land papers to his aide, Vishal, who used the number 81**8666** to coordinate with Bali and the victim.

Tihar has around 35-40 jammers, including devices that jam 3G signals. However, Bali's case has exposed weaknesses in the jail's security. Police will apprise the Tihar administration of the case and ask them to beef up security.

Deputy commissioner of police Rajiv Ranjan said his teams have arrested Vishal Maan and two other shooters, identified as Santosh Bahadur from Nepal and Nizam from Ghaziabad, on charges of extortion in the case.

Vishal and the other two were arrested on a tip-off that they would be traveling in a Honda City car (DL 4C AH 8235) and pass through Delhi Jal Board's office. Police flagged down the car but Vishal tried to escape but the car was chased and intercepted by a police van driven by ASI Ashok.

The men were overpowered by the team led by inspector Sanjay Nagpal. "Three loaded pistols, three mobile phones and sim cards were recovered from them. With this, an extortion racket being run from Tihar Jail, has been busted," Ranjan added.

On the basis of disclosures and phone intercepts, the cops sought the custody of Naveen Bali from Tihar. Bali, police said, was gathering funds for Delhi's most wanted gangsters, Neeraj Bawana and Amit Bhura.

Bawana has jumped parole while Bhura had fled after snatching four AK-47 rifles from policemen. Both are suspected to be operating from neighbouring states but have plans to escape to Nepal.
