S'  The Brownfield Briefing Awards 2013 recognized Regenesis Remediation Technologies and Hyder Consulting with two awards. San Clemente, CA, US - November 14th, 2013 /MarketersMedia/ -- Regenesis Remediation Technologies and Hyder Consulting were recently recognized at the Brownfield Briefing Awards 2013 held in late October. The companies worked together on an in-situ bioremediation project which received two industry awards: \'Best In-Situ Remedial Treatment\' and \'Best Project Closure/Verification Process\'. The awards ceremony, held annually in London, recognizes best practice and innovation in brownfield development and contaminated site remediation. The awards were given in recognition of a voluntary brownfield clean-up project in Little Hulton near Manchester, UK which was undertaken on behalf of Johnsons Apparelmaster. Hyder and Regenesis joined forces to successfully treat historic chlorinated solvent groundwater contamination (pre-dating Johnsons\' ownership) beneath an active dry cleaning facility. The award for \'Best In-Situ Treatment\' came from the fact that this site was heavily impacted with high levels of chlorinated solvents (concentrations in excess of 250,000 ?g/L and residual DNAPL) and was successfully treated and closed with a single enhanced bioremediation application. The second award for \'Best Project Closure /Verification Process\' was presented based on the merits of the multiple lines of technical evidence that were used to document treatment performance and regulatory closure. George Flower, Hyder\'s Technical Director specializing in land remediation, and Gareth Leonard, Regenesis\' UK & Scandinavia District Manager, received the two awards from the BBC\'s Kate Bellingham. Speaking on behalf of the judges, she announced: "This project was an excellent example of how existing technology can be thoughtfully applied", and: "This highly technical groundwater remediation project impressed the judges. It demonstrated a range of techniques that were used to gather high quality data to monitor the progress and the success of the project". Hyder was responsible for conceptualizing the site, undertaking risk assessments and identifying remedial options, while Regenesis deployed detailed treatment design and managed the application of in-situ remediation technologies to ensure efficient contaminant treatment without disrupting daily site operations. Dr. Jeremy Birnstingl, Managing Director of Regenesis in Europe added: "We\'re particularly pleased with this recognition. Treating such high levels of chlorinated solvents with a one-time reagent application demonstrates the power of the technology, properly applied. Given this, it expands the boundaries of what many believed possible, the second award for best verification is doubly welcome." After the ceremony George Flower of Hyder commented: "These awards recognize the collaboration and hard work undertaken by both teams as well as the technical expertise and innovation applied to remediate the groundwater beneath the site, achieving the required result for the client."
